# How to Run
Personally, I'd recommend opening the html page in Chrome since the animations are faster and the sounds will actually sync up.  To do this you'll have to start chrome from the command line and add `--allow-file-access-from-files`, then specify the html file using `file:[user path]/project/proj4.html`.

You can also open it in another browser but the animations and sounds might not sync up correctly.

Once loaded, press 'a' to animate the scene.  You can press 'a' again to pause the animation.  Press 'b' to reset the camera back to its original position and orientation.

NOTE: The `Common` directory was provided by the professor and is required for `proj4.html` and `proj4.js` to work correctly.
